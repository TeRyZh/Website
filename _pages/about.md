I am a fifth-year Ph.D. candidate in Civil and Environmental Engineering from Rutrgers University. My main research efforts include cooperative and intelligent transportation systems. My dissertation topic is to develop a non-conventional vehicle detection and validation method for high-resolution trajectory collection using computer vision and LiDAR sensors. 

I am looking for research scientist or Post-Doc position to continue the research of combining computer vision, machine learning with connected and automated technology to build safe, green and smart mobility applications.
