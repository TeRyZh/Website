A Github Pages for academic websites.

if you want to use a gif for your github repository README.md and don't want to address it from your root directory, it's not enough if you just copy the url of your browser, for example your browser URL is sth like:

https://github.com/TeRyZh/Website/blob/main/images/Detection%20and%20Tracking_small.png

but you should open your gif in a new tab and click copy image address or sth like that which is sth like this:

https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TeRyZh/Website/main/images/Detection%20and%20Tracking_small.png

or 

https://github.com/TeRyZh/Website/blob/main/images/HASDA%20Model%20Detection.gif?raw=true
