I am a final year Ph.D. candidate in Civil and Environmental Engineering from Rutgers University. My main research efforts involve cooperative and intelligent transportation systems. My dissertation topic is to develop a non-conventional video detection and validation method for high-resolution trajectory collection using camera and LiDAR sensors. 

I am looking for academic or industrial position to continue the work of combining machine learning, computer vision with connected and automated technology to build safe, green and smart mobility applications.

Research Interests
======
### Transportation AI and Data Science
Applying computer vision, LiDAR, and drone-based remote sensing to collect high-resolution data for research and innovations. Scientific machine learning for traffic modeling, control and prediction.
