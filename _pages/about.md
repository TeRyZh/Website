I am a fifth-year Ph.D. candidate in Civil and Environmental Engineering from Rutgers University. My main research efforts involve cooperative and intelligent transportation systems. My dissertation topic is to develop a non-conventional video detection and validation method for high-resolution trajectory collection using camera and LiDAR sensors. 

I am looking for research scientist or postdoc position to continue the work of combining machine learning, computer vision with connected and automated technology to build safe, green and smart mobility applications.
