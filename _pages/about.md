I am a final year Ph.D. candidate and an incoming postdoc researcher from Rutgers University. My main research efforts involve cooperative and intelligent transportation systems. My dissertation topic is to develop a non-conventional video detection and validation method for high-resolution trajectory collection using computer vision and 3D Point Clouds. 

I am looking for academic or industrial position to continue the work of combining machine learning, computer vision with connected and automated technology to build safe, green and smart mobility applications.


### Traffic Detection and Sensing
